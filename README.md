## 💡 What This Project Does
- Reads a customer call list from an Excel file.

- Fills or drops missing values in key columns like phone numbers and customer names.
- Standardizes column names and phone number formats.
- Trims extra spaces and corrects text casing.
- Exports the cleaned data to a new Excel file for use in CRM systems or further analysis.
